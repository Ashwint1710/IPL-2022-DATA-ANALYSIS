The project aims to analyse the intricacies of the IPL 2024 auction, focusing on player transactions, team compositions, and financial investments. The primary objective is to understand the dynamics of player acquisition, categorizing players into different roles, such as batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, and wicketkeepers. By examining the count of sold and unsold players, the project seeks to unveil the competitiveness of the auction process and teams' strategic decisions. Additionally, the analysis delves into team-specific player acquisitions, identifying the highest amounts spent on individual players and top performers in each category. The project aims to provide valuable insights into player market trends, team dynamics, and competitive strategies within the IPL ecosystem.

Here are the questions with proper formatting:
1. How many players participated in the auction process?
2. How many players participated in each category?
3. Create a pie chart showing the percentage of roles of players who participated.
4. Create a bar graph showing the count of sold and unsold players.
5. How many players were bought by each team in the IPL auction?
6. How many players were retained, acquired from the auction, and picked in the draft?
7. Create a bar graph showing the different types of players in each team.
8. What was the highest amount spent by teams for an individual player?
9. What was the highest amount spent for retaining a player in the IPL?
10. Who was the top bowler sold in the auction?
11. Who was the top batter sold in the auction?
12. Who was the top all-rounder sold in the auction?
13. Who was the top wicketkeeper sold in the auction?
14. Which unsold players were sold in the previous year?
15. What is the total count of unsold players?

𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 :

After conducting the analysis of the IPL 2024 auction data, several key insights emerge. Firstly, a total count of players participating in the auction process indicates the magnitude of player transactions within the league. Categorizing players into different roles, such as batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, and wicketkeepers, provides a comprehensive understanding of the player composition. Visualizing this distribution through a pie chart offers a clear depiction of the player roles prevalent in the league.
Furthermore, examining the count of sold and unsold players highlights the competitiveness of the auction and the teams' strategies in player acquisition. Understanding the number of players bought by each team reveals insights into team dynamics and resource allocation strategies. Additionally, analysing the distribution of player types within each team sheds light on the team's strengths and weaknesses.
Moreover, identifying the highest amount spent by teams for individual players underscores the value teams attribute to certain players. The analysis also identifies the top performers in each category, such as bowlers, batters, all-rounders, and wicketkeepers, who commanded the highest prices in the auction.
Finally, the list of unsold players from the current auction who were sold in the previous year provides insights into player performance trends and market fluctuations. Overall, this analysis offers valuable insights into the dynamics of player transactions, team strategies, and the competitive landscape of the IPL.
